    # Abilities
    * [[Animal Mimicry]] - She can obtain the physique and abilities of animals by merely touching them. However, she can only use it for one hour. And she require contact with each animal if she wants to use it, hence why she always carries a cat with her, a gecko or bird.

    **Weakness**: If she used her ability for more than 1 hour, she risks permanently acquiring the physique of whatever animal she took form off.
