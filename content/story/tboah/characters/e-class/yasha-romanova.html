    # Appearance
    Yasha is a beautiful and tall girl with black silky hair reaching her waist usually tied at the bottom. She has light skin and a pair of clear and sharp Indigo eyes. When her ability activates, her Indigo eyes shines an Indigo light.

    # Personality
    Much like her ability, Yasha is a very direct and straightforward person. She does not hesitate to tell what's wrong and what's good. She used to have a very timid personality, but after Cassandra's death, she started to become more and more assertive, reaching a point where her personality practically copies that of Cassandra.

    She hates liars and sees exacts heavy punishment against wrong doings. She has a hard time understanding people's weaknesses, but she can be extremely kind to the timid, reminding her of what she used to be.

    # Motivation
    As the one of the few remaining survivor of [[Project Iris]], Yasha carries a heart filled with grudge. She enrolled in U.H.A. to become strong and influential enough to bring light towards Chambord's evil experiments and exact revenge on the scientists and people that invested on the failed project.

    # History
    She was born powerless and was sold by her parents to the Project, meant to be used as a guinue pig. There, she met a girl named Cassandra who taught her much about the world. The two of them quickly became best friends, sharing secrets and dreams.

    One day, when an accident occurred and Cassandra died from overdose, the researchers took her indigo eyes and forcibly replaced Yasha's black eyes with it. Testing proved successful and Yasha successfully utilized an enhanced version of Cassandra's eyes.

    An attack from a villain group allowed Yasha to escape. She ran to the sea and for five days, did not eat nor sleep as she floated alone in the cold deadly waters. She was eventually found by an old fisherman who decided to take her in.

    # Abilities
    **Flaw Fracture** - She can perceive the weakest point in objects. Using her power, she can strike these points enabling her to always have a lethal attack. Whenever she activates her eyes, a small light comes out seemingly scanning her enemies.

    * **Weakness**: If the enemy is fast enough to block the light from her eyes, Yasha is unable to scan them for their weakest points. She also must keep her eyes opened for the weak spot to become apparent, else the light that guides her to the weakest point will disappear. Although she overcame this weakness by training her memory.

    # Equipment
    Yasha usually wields a black hammer with spiky end, a piece of weapon that her Adoptive Father made for her.

    # Relationships
    **Grandpa Terrian** - He is a very old fisherman, old enough to have seen many countries created throughout his life. He took Yasha when she was 10 as his adoptive granddaughter and raised well as if she was his own flesh and flood. Yasha is very close to him and loves him dearly, openly telling him her worries and fears. Although she has been very concerned of his health as he's nearing an age of 145.
