    # Appearance
    Kevin is a handsome tall young boy with spiky blond hair and blue eyes. He has a muscular physique like Ethan brought about by his boiling nature of constantly wanting to fight others.

    # Personality
    Kevin has an aggressive and boiling personality, always constantly wanting to fight others and beat them up. But as he grew up, he learned to tamed this nature and he became a cheerful and bright, albeit still aggressive, kind young boy.

    However, his personality took a dive after the incident with Vanessa, causing him to lose his cheerfulness and turning him bitter and frustrated.
    # Motivation
    He wants to find the Crawler that took Vanessa's powers and kill him.

    # History
    He always wanted to become number one, inspired by his father who is a hero by profession. But Kevin did not understood what it meant to be Hero and he thought a Hero is a cool guy that beats up bad guys, hence when he was a kid, Kevin liked to beat up others. However, he met his first defeat in the hands of the young but crafty [[Ethan Morales]], who mercilessly beat him up with stones.

    After the accident with Vanessa, he became listless, bitter, frustrated, and generally anti-social. He hated Ethan for saving him and not saving Vanessa, but the truth is he never hated Ethan, he was merely venting his frustration. Who he truly hates is himself, his inability to protect her and his guilt of putting all burden to Ethan.

    He hated himself, because he was weak, because he was foolish, because he said he wanted to become a Hero without even understanding what it truly means to be One.

    At some point during the 8 years he grew up with Ethan, he came to see him as his Big Brother. He admired how Ethan always finds a way out of situations, how Ethan never let his weakness prevent him from getting his goal, and how he envied him and at the same time, deeply idolizes how Ethan succeeded from turning his weak flame into a powerful creation power.
