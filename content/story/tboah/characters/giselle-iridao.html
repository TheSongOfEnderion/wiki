    [[toc]]

    # Appearance
    Giselle is a beautiful young girl, possessing silky brown hair which she ties in a side pony-tail. She had blue eyes and snow-white skin. She often sports a bright look in her eyes and is often seen smiling. She dislikes wearing revealing clothes, always wearing long skirts and sleeve shirts.

    # Personality
    Giselle is an optimistic, bubbly, and bright young girl, often seen smiling and cheering others. Unlike her ice powers, Giselle is very warm towards others. However, she often acts childish in many situations.

    Giselle has an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, prompting her to click and press any lever, button, or switch she can find. Hence she always carries a button toy with her so she can control her impulses. However, she often feels very happy when she clicks actual buttons, switches, or levers. This makes Giselle one of the most dangerous members of [[E-Class]] as regardless of the perceived danger, Giselle will still activate a button for the sake of clicking it.

    Giselle often is often seen with a warm and bubbly personality, but the truth is she is incapable of feeling Empathy and was taught by her parents to act like this as to not disturb others. Although she feels love towards her parents, she finds it difficult to understand the suffering of other people. Giselle is perfectly capable of committing crimes such as murder without feeling a little disturb, simply continuing to smile without a care.

    Her insanity manifested in the joy she receives whenever she activates buttons, levers, or switches.

    # Ability
    ## Active
    * **Ice Vortex** - the ability to create a lasting ice vortex that freezes its surrounding and pulls entities inside of it.
    * **Genius Intellect** - Giselle is remarkably intelligent, well capable of solving complex puzzles and mathematical problems with practically no effort. She is capable of imagining entire realities in her mind, often entertaining herself with her mere imaginations. However, Giselle requires to actively use her intellect as often times she acts rather stupid and air-headed.

    ## Passive
    * **Frost Immunity** - Giselle is immune to practically all conventional Ice or Frost attacks. She is capable of handling temperatures even at absolute zero without any repercussions. Her weaker attack power is off-set by her immunity, which is one of the strongest resistance power in the current era.
