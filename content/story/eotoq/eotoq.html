    Euphemia is an orphan and a humble maid serving in the palace of the Kingdom's Royal Family. She spends her days idly, doing what a good servant does, and on her day offs, does her clock work hobby. Recently, the lost daughter of a Duke's family was found, Lady Canaria. A beautiful and graceful woman who immediately attracted the attention of the five best bachelors of the Kingdom. Though despite all of that, none of these mattered to the air-headed and naive Euphemia.

    One day, Euphemia found an [[Ordinary Quill]] within her room. She wrote with it and on that night, saw a vision of the future... of Euphemia seating on the Iron Throne, surrounded by knights and loyal servants. In front of a massive crowd, she gave the order to behead Lady Canaria and her five lovers.

    And on that vision, that Euphemia she saw declared, "Now, I am Monarch"
