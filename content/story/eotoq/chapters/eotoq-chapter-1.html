    IT WAS SUPPOSED TO be the same morning for Euphemia. She quietly sweeps the beautiful and yellowish parquet floor of interlocking diagonal wood with her light broom. But she suddenly noticed the stomping, the frantic hurry, and the erratic breathing of her fellow servants. She looked at the crawling maids with strange eyes. They swiftly searched each and every corner, as if something important was lost. Even the lazy Farriah was running about. What could have been the commotion? Wondered by the maid Euphemia.

    "… Farriah", Euphemia tapped the shoulder of the kneeling maid. She was busy lifting small pots of plants one after another, looking at their bottom.

    "… What is happening?", Euphemia lightly tilted her head.

    "My goodness Euphemia!", Farriah raised both arms. She scrambled her brown hair, tied with a small twin-tail on both sides.

    "You've been here the longest, but how is your brain still filled with air?", She placed her hands in her hips, glaring at the blinking Euphemia. Her blank eyes revealed that she still did not understand what was happening. As Farriah stared at her, she closely looked at the only dark-haired person within the palace. With dark eyes and pearly white skin, and a pretty face, Farriah was surprised no noble has snatched her yet. It's most likely because she's not an Arsean, Farriah frowned.

    '_Well, it's good that my efforts are not in vain_', Farriah sighed.

    "*Hayy*… The Lord of Magic, Gallanor has lost an important Quill! He is very, very angry right now and threatens to wipe out all the servants! We must find that White Quill!"

    "… Oh? A Quill…", Euphemia tilted her head. She tried thinking about it, but she found it weird.

    "… Aren't Tower Lords very wealthy? Why won't he just buy a new one?"

    "Oh god…", Farriah pulled her hair apart. She started thinking that not only should Euphemia not be left alone, she must also never meet any guest, or by the Will of Aeolius she will bring them trouble!

    "Euphe, why don't you go", and as Farriah phrased her the following words, she wryly smiled, "… to the storage rooms! North, where we store the preserved food! We might have missed something there!"

    "Oh, okay!", Euphemia nodded. Turning around, she started lightly jogging while holding her broom.

    "Uwah… I kind of feel bad sending the airheaded Euphe away. But It's for the sake of everyone!", and so Farriah returned to the floor, frantically searching every nook and cranny, hoping to find the quill, but also hoping that she would be rewarded if she did so.

    ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

    EUPHEMIA STARTED WALKING TOWARDS the north Palace corridor. She walked along the intricately and well-designed baroque white walls, lightly tinted by an old yellowish color. The light green curtains draped the high windows, each fitted with a golden-like frame and clear glass. Marbles decorated each of the support columns.

    As Euphemia walked, she lightly placed a finger along the walls, the vases, and the pots of plants, before looking her finger.

    "… Oh dear", Euphemia lightly exclaimed, "Dust. Euphemia must clean these"

    The light of the morning sun pierced through the high windows, lighting up her face. Euphemia liked the morning light because it always made her feel warm. It makes her forget the cold and bitter days during winter.

    She started brooming the floor, wiping the dust with a cloth, and shaking the curtains. All in a span of a few dozen minutes, she cleaned that corridor, completely forgetting what her friend told her to do.

    It was then that Euphemia noticed a movement at the corner of her eyes. She stoically turned in that direction as she put the duster down. Beyond the window, into the gardens, she saw a beautiful and pink haired woman of great proportions. Her breast was bountiful, her hair was silky, her skin was jade-white, and her eyes emitted a beautiful blueish color.

    Lady Canaria, the first daughter and only heir to an esteemed Ducal Family. Rumor has it that she was raised in an orphanage when her biological mother ran away during childbirth, and that only in the past five years she was found. Euphemia thought that she must have lived a difficult life.

    Many people think she's perfect, but Euphemia didn't think so. What kind of life is perfect when you can't even properly eat the food you want or spend time by yourself? Euphemia thought it was quite sad.

    She saw the beautiful woman sat down at an artistically intricate chair, carved with drawings of entities and Primordials, made of steel, painted with white, and a wooly cushion. Right

    Suddenly, Euphemia noticed a man approach her.

    He wore a pair of dark-blue robes, etched with gold and silver at each corner, forming lightning-like designs. His gray hair flowed down to his waist and his blue eyes stared forth with a mighty dignity.

    "… Oh, that man is Lord Gallanor", Euphemia lightly nodded.

    She could not hear what he was saying. But he sat right before the lady, and suddenly all the coldness in his beautiful face disappeared. What was left was that of warmth, love, and happiness.

    Euphemia recognized those emotions, but it was alien to her. She could never feel them. But Euphemia never had to think about it, never had to bother.

    And then she witnessed four men suddenly appear before the table. Euphemia recognized them too. They were the Crown Prince, the Guard's Captain, The Crow Prince's Secretary, and a Warrior from a Ducal Family.

    "… Wait, oh dear. I need to leave for the storage room", and so she hurriedly walked, prancing about with a quite "ham" sound coming from her mouth. But as she walked, she remembered Lord Gallanor's face.

    Farriah said Lord Gallanor was angry, but his face is far from such a thing. So why doesn't he just buy a new quill? Even poor Euphemia can afford a cheap one if she wants.

    "… Oh, right. I forgot to water the plants back in my room"

    And so, the day passed.

    But the White Quill was yet to be found.

    Lord Gallanor was mad. He strode forth, from the direction where Euphemia once was sweeping the floor. As he glared in the room whence he stays during his visits, a row of servants stood right outside. He frowned and pointed his fingers at them.

    "SOMEONE entered my room!", veins popped in his forehead as his face contorted in an ugly shape, "CLEANED my room, REMOVED every dust, and took MY quill! Which one of you peasants did it?! I swear by Aeolius' Spirit, you will see him today!"

    The servants remained looking down. Sweat poured through their darkened and shivering faces. None of them dared to even breathe a little loudly, in fear of acquiring the wrath of one of these godlike men. For what are they but mere simple servants? The life of one is as disposable as any other.

    "Now, now, Gallanor", and suddenly, like the Light of the God Aeolius, the warm and gentle words of that person calmed the hearts of the servants.

    He was a beautiful man, golden in hair, and azure in eyes. He was lightly smiling while accompanying a beautiful pink haired woman wearing an intricate pink dress right beside him.

    "You shouldn't terrify my servants like this. For what it's worth, you could have just misplaced them"

    "Do you take me for a fool, Alistair?", Gallanor stared at him with raised lips, "I would NEVER lose an item of such great importance! That quill is the key to understanding the Past and the extinct races that once walked our world! I MUST find it!"

    "Gallanor…", the woman standing beside the golden-haired man, Alistair, suddenly opened her mouth. Upon hearing her, Gallanor flinched. The anger in his face seems to have dissipated by a large degree.

    Witnessing this, the servants quietly breathed with great relief.

    All hail Lady Canaria! Each of them cheered within their minds.

    "I understand this quill is of utmost important", Canaria gently spoke, "But please, my servants were each carefully chosen by the Royal Mages. Their loyalty is assured. If you would like, we can just use an illusion spell to seek out the truth from each of them. And besides, powerful magic rune fills your room. How could mere servants enter them?"

    "Oh, you're right…", Gallanor sighed. He opened his eyes and lightly bowed to Canaria.

    "Forgive me. I have lost my temper. It's just this quill is too important f me"

    "I know…", Canaria smiled.

    "I will help with the best I could", And for a moment, her eyes became blank.

    ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

    EUPHEMIA WAS BUSY SCRUBBING the dishes with a cloth and a soap. As the water flowed through the faucet, she immediately closed it once it filled the basin. She was within the royal kitchen; it was night already and the royals already finished their dinner.

    The walls were a bit warm, made from grayish bricks, each corner supported by a column arching to the high ceiling. It was only the lamplight, chained above from the ceiling, that gave them the ability to see. As it was nighttime, the duties of most servants start to become finished, allowing them time for chatter.

    And they did. Euphemia handed the porcelain dishware to the fellow maid to her left. She heard their whispers, of the events that occurred today.

    "Ugh, Lord Gallanor was so scary!"

    "I know right? If it was not for her highness, we would have really been dead!"

    "So, the rumours were true? Lord Gallanor is a murderous psychopath who only cares about magic and research, but the Lady managed to tame him?"

    "Yes! I saw it today!"

    "Oh my! It's so romantic!"

    Euphemia quietly scrubbed the dishes. She did not understand what everyone is so excited about. Even more so, what they meant by romantic.

    He likes to kill people and treats them without any respect. Anyone thinking its romantic to tame such a man is beyond Euphemia. She thought that such people are scary, and you should stay away from them.

    Once the work was done, it was now time for the servants to eat.

    "Ugh… Finally done", Euphemia heard the groans of Farriah. As the two sat at the table chair within the kitchen with the other servants, they quietly took a leaf from a tray and started eating with the wooden forks. They always used the leaves since it was easier to throw them than to wash the dishes again.

    Euphemia took a piece of sliced yellow fruit, a piece of rye bread, and a cup of soup. She didn't think much about the food, as it was no different from mere activity to her. Although sometimes she can feel her lips drool at the sight of nobles eating meat and fish. She always wanted to eat fish, but the greed in her eyes caused the head maid to never assign her to serving the guests ever again.

    Euphemia thought it was unfair, but she stopped thinking about it eventually.

    "Hayy… ", A woman of aged and wrinkled look, sighed in front of them. She sat at the head of the table, with everyone seating at the sides. Her graying blond hair was tied in a bun, and a rectangular eyeglass fitted her weakening eyes. She was the head maid of the Palace and the one that took Euphemia in. She always looked up to her, seeing her as a mother figure and always doing what she was told.

    "It took so much time for their illusion spell to finish", the Head Maid complained, "In the end, nothing of value was found. Geez"

    The fellow servants all nodded in return. And then the head maid then smiled in satisfaction.

    "I'm proud that none of you guys stole it.", everyone smiled at her warmly, "The interrogation earlier proved it that everyone here is chosen rightly to serve the Palace. No one here is…", and it was at that moment that her eyes landed upon Euphemia.

    Witnessing the head maid's widened eyes, they stared in that direction and simply saw Euphemia blankly eating her food, without, quite literally, thinking of anything. Farriah's face became pale. It was at that moment that everyone realized something.

    Euphemia wasn't there during the interrogation.

    Their faces darkened and sweat started pouring through their back. The more they think about it, the more dread fills their mind.

    "Eu-Eu-Euphemia!!", the Head Maid slammed the table. Her grayish-blue eyes frantically shook as she glared at her.

    "Where were you during afternoon?", loudly shouted by the head maid.

    Besides Euphemia, Farriah was looking back and forth swiftly, panicking, and shaking.

    '_You've finally done it now Euphemia!_', Farriah screamed internally, pulling her twintails apart.

    "Me?", Euphemia tilted her head.

    "I was cleaning the storage room", she calmly explained, with her soft and almost translucent voice, "Farriah told me to"

    The head maid's brows immediately creased towards Farriah. Feeling a heavy weight land on her shoulder, Farriah gulped.

    "I-I-I told her to clean there so-so, you know, c-c-cause the place needs cleaning! Hehehe"

    "I see", the head maid straightened herself.

    She started walking around the table, every step she took made a ticktock sound as if it was the movement of a clock. Everyone looked at her in silence. As she stopped before Euphemia, she asked her to stand up which she quietly obliged.

    "Alright girls. Search her!"

    ""Yes!""

    "… Hmm?"

    And so, in less than a minute, within this room full of women, Euphemia stood in just her underwear. Euphemia didn't think much of it, but she pouted that it was quite chilly. As the servants combed through her cloths and to every corner of her body, they found nothing.

    "Where did you clean before the storage room?", the head maid squinted her eyes.

    "… Oh, that's easy…", Euphemia quietly declared, "I cleaned in…"

    And nothing came to mind.

    "… I don't remember"

    "Why won't you remember?!", The head maid touched her glabella.

    "Euphemia my dear!", she placed both her arms in Euphemia's shoulders. And with widened eyes, she spoke in a deep and risqué voice.

    "Please, please my dear, REMEMBER where you last cleaned!"

    "…"

    "…."

    "… Euphemia can't remember"

    "AHH! Not this again!"

    Euphemia's brain truly was filled with air, Farriah shook her head at the side. She recalled the many times Euphemia caused trouble because of completely forgetting entire orders. And then suddenly, Farriah remembered her first encounter with her this morning.

    She stood five meters away from Lord Gallanor's room.

    Farriah's eyes slowly widened. Her heart started beating so fast that she felt her sweat reversely go up her forehead.

    '_No, no. It can't be_', once more, Farriah shook her head.

    '_In the first place, Lord Gallanor placed some magic or something in his room. It's impossible for airheaded Euphemia to enter it!_'

    She secretly glanced at the blank looking Euphemia, clearly not understanding the lecture that the head maid was giving.

    '_Yeah, it's impossible. Let's believe in Euphemia… hahaha_', Farriah convinced herself.


    ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


    "… Why is there a quill on my bed?"

    Euphemia blinked at an old and faded white quill laying in her bed. It was already nighttime, and the only source of light within her tiny room was the lamp at the small desk by her bedside.

    While wearing a weathered ashen nightgown made from linen, she blankly stared at the quill.

    Euphemia picked it up. It had a white feather, and in the place of the feather tip was a small metallic cylinder. The design was quite peculiar. It was filled with one of those funny looking glade-like oval designs from the ancient elves from hundreds of thousands of years ago, Euphemia thought.

    And then something flashed through her mind.

    "… Ahh."

    A sudden realization.

    "… Euphemia needed a new drawing pen", Euphemia lightly smiled.

    "… The Dove must have answered my prayers", Euphemia then suddenly kneeled at the ground. She clasped both hands as she stared at the crudely made altar on her window. It was made of straws and scrap wood, depicting a dove with a blue flower on its bottom and a piece of bread with a small bite on it.

    "… Thank you, Goddess", Euphemia lightly smiled. As the passing clouds blocked the moon light shining through her room, Euphemia immediately stood up, swiftly snatched the bread… and ate it.

    She looked around the room and then when the light returned, she quickly kneeled again and continued praying.

    "… Thank you, Goddess,", a quiet wind entered through her windows, brushing the pots of plants and lightly touching her head. She felt as if she could hear the sound of laughter. But she dismissed the thought, thinking it was just her imagination.

    Euphemia returned to her desk.

    After giving her prayers, she took out a box and few tools from the drawer. Laying out a soft leather cloth on the desk, Euphemia started placing different kinds of small items, gears, screws and more from the box.

    She then took out an eyeglass with the right side having a three circular metal where one can place different kinds of lenses. And so, Euphemia begun the one and only hobby she has.

    She quietly began her work. She opened an old box and took out three old lenses. After placing the three lens on the special eyeglass, she wore it, giving her a closer look at the tiny mechanical parts. She began assembling and repairing a small watch.

    Time passes, and the only thing that can be heard from her room was the tick-tock sound of a clock on her desk. And then… for some reason, she noticed something in the corner of her eyes.

    The quill was on her desk.

    When did I place this here? Euphemia wondered.

    But she remembered needing to try it. So, she took a small ink glass and a beige and rough paper from her drawer. Euphemia dripped her pen on the ink, and she began writing.

    "… What should Euphemia write? Oh, I guess my name?"

    Euphemia.

    "… I don't have a last name…"

    She played with the quill for a bit.

    "… It's a nice quill. I guess it's quite ordinary? The ink looked as rough as ordinary ones"

    When she thought about a last name, Euphemia remembered the five men fawning over lady Canaria and the idea of marriage.

    Will I get married somebody? A man is going to come to my life and make love with me? Does that mean I will get his surname?

    Euphemia never really gave it much thought before. But she often heard the chatter of her fellow servants, about dreams of a gallant knight or a dashing noble coming to their life and making them their wives. Euphemia didn't really understand why they would want that, as she never particularly desired them.

    For to Euphemia, there was no meaning to dreaming. Everything was set.

    "… Future huh… hmm?"

    Before she realized it, Euphemia wrote the following words.

    I want to see my future.

    "… Oh…"

    She looked at it closely. But she stopped herself. She hid the paper beneath her drawer and she began working. As she continued to work, the usual stoic Euphemia started feeling her eyes becoming a blur. A surge of memories rushed into her mind. Fond, and sweet memories that made her smile, as well as sad and terrible ones that made her feel bitter.

    Her hands shivered a bit, as she remembered the dreams she once had.

    And the reason for why it held no meaning.

    She remembered her childhood, of dreams of wanting to become someone greater. But those dreams lead to the lost of something far important to her. She tried her best to keep her arms steady, but as the tiny gears fell, so did the tears from her dark eyes.

    She stared at the clock she's fixing. And then she realized her life is like this clock, broken, unmoving, unthinking. But Euphemia bit her lips, wiping the tears from her eyes. She continued working, trying her best, desperately. Clocksmithing was all she truly knew…

    Because it was the one thing that she inherited from her mother.

    And the only thing she remembers of her.


    ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇


    EUPHEMIA OPENED HER EYES.

    She felt something was a bit wrong. Because from her expectations, she was supposed to see an old, crumbling ceiling… and not a sky in the middle of a twilight.

    Euphemia raised her body. Looking around with half-closed eyes, she saw a forest with dense gray fog, sending a cold shiver down through her spine. There were dark green grass in the ground, and sinister looking stones beyond the fog. It made her feel rattled, disturbed. She grasped her shoulders and begun rubbing them.

    "… Eh? Eh? Why is Euphemia here?", she frantically turned around with widened eyes.

    "… F-Farriah?", Euphemia turned to her back, only to see an equally dense shadowy fog.

    "… Head maid? A-ANyone?", Euphemia froze. Her eyes started shaking and tears started building up.

    "… Ugh… why am I here?", it was then, that Euphemia noticed something move from the corner of her eyes. She immediately glared in its direction with a pair of sharp eyes.

    And then, behind the tree, she witnessed a golden hair poking out. It must be a kid from this height, Euphemia judged. But what made her tilt her head was the strange poking sharp ears.

    Suddenly, that person moved. Euphemia immediately took a step-back. Her heart began beating faster. With a drop of a leaf, Euphemia prepared to bolt in the opposite direction. But as the person slowly came out of the shadow, Euphemia widened her eyes.

    Upon seeing the kid, she could only think of one word.

    Elf.

    Even the poorly educated Euphemia knew them. The elders liked to speak about them, of legends of a race that can naturally wield magic, unlike men. Of a race where each one of them were so stunningly beautiful that their ugliest is humanity's most beautiful.

    And Euphemia finally understood what the fuss was all about. This kid in front of her which she judged must be a little girl… was so beautiful. Draped in strange greenish feathery cloth as if it was made of plant fiber, Euphemia thought that its craftsmanship was so fine and exquisite it made even the King's clothe look like a piece of rag.

    "… Oh."

    But alas, all of them were dead. The only evidence of their existence were strange monolithic and faded towers spread across the continent.

    So, Euphemia rationalized.

    I must be dreaming right now, she calmly thought as she relaxed her body. No way a member of an extinct race will appear in front of her, right?

    "… U-Um… hello?"

    The little elf kid then begun running away.

    "… W-Wait!", quickly, Euphemia chased after.

    Running across the forest, across the lake, Euphemia kept following her. Through the downtrodden slope and through the giant roots of trees. She kept shouting, and asking her to stop, but she wouldn't.

    It was then that Euphemia realized… the little girl was leading her. For when she felt too tired to run, the kid would stop and just stare at her.

    And then, when they finally exit the forest, a bright light pierced through Euphemia's eyes. She held her arms forward, and when she adjusted to the light, she could finally see what was in front of her.

    It was a massive city.

    But that wasn't what bothered her, nor was it the fact that it was the city where she lived and served… It was the fact that the city was draped by a bloody banner, and the people were on the streets, screaming of murder.

    What is this? Euphemia tilted her head.

    And then, she noticed to her left. The little elven girl quietly stood there. Suddenly, it pointed its arms in the direction of the castle.

    "… The King lives there. What about it?", Euphemia squinted her eyes. She's starting to think that this dream might drag for too long. She remembered that the last time she had a long dream, she woke up too late and was scolded by the head maid.

    "… Can we make this quick? I need to wake up early"

    And then, out of nowhere…

    Euphemia suddenly stood in the middle of the city plaza.

    "… Eh?"

    She turned around and witnessed the same people she saw from afar. They were all ragged, haggard, thin, and malnourished. Their tunic clothing were tarnished by blood and mud, and their widened fanatical eyes made Euphemia… shiver.

    "Kill them!"

    "Burn them!"

    "Those traitorous nobles!"

    "They failed their duties!"

    "It is Annariah's Will to have them burned!"

    Euphemia started shaking. Her face paled, and she started tearing up. She felt her legs start feeling noodly and her chest tightening as if suffocating her.

    Losing the strength from her feet, she slowly squats on her legs, and then, blocking her head with both hands.

    "… Ugh… this is too scary for Euphemia…"

    Suddenly, she felt a tugging in her shoulder.

    She slowly raised her head, and she saw the elven little girl, pointing in the direction from her back.

    "… Ughh… Can we end this already?"

    But the little girl shook her head. She retracted her right hand and kept pointing again in that direction. Left with no choice, Euphemia slowly turned around.

    And what she saw… slowly widened her eyes.

    Six people kneeled in a row in front of her.

    Each of them had a sack covering their head, but Euphemia has seen them long enough to not know who they were.

    Lord Gallanor, the Crown Prince, his Secretary, the Guard's Captain, a Warrior from a Ducal Family… and lady Canaria.

    Each of them were battered, bruised, tortured, blooded. A crimson sack covered their face, continuously bleeding, like the humming of a clock.

    But that was not what shocked Euphemia… it was the person right behind them…

    A woman was seating on a golden throne, with a row of servants and knights right behind her. She wore a provocative clothing, a black bra made of silk draping across her breast, and an underwear of similar black fabric, held together by three, light string on both sides. Her shoulder held a golden pauldron, carrying with it a black silky cape, laced with golds and gemstones, forming the shape of a butterfly. And finally, tied in a low braided ponytail, her hair hang on her front right.

    Many jewelries of gold and myriad of gemstones decorated her neck and her arms. And on her head, a Golden Crown quietly rests. She was very beautiful, Euphemia thought.

    That person wore the face of a lion, fierce, courageous, and dominating. It was the same face that the King always held, and it made Euphemia feel… suffocated, afraid.

    That person… was completely unlike her. Except for one fact…

    She wore the same face as Euphemia.

    "… What?"

    "Kill them"

    "… Huh?"

    Knights stared walking, moving right behind the six people kneeling. And with that person's wave of her hand, all the knights swung their sword, instantly ending their lives.

    The crowd cheered, the crowd rejoiced, and the crowd laughed.

    But Euphemia… was frozen.

    She stared in the direction of that woman. And somehow, that woman… was also staring in her direction, The two made eye contact. It was then that Euphemia realized the only difference between their faces. Euphemia had dark eyes, while she had a blood crimson eyes.

    And then, the frozen Euphemia saw her… smile.

    "And now…", that woman spoke with her deep, feminine voice.

    She stood up and slowly walked across the platform. Her dark cape dripped through the floor as the cheering of thousands made it sway.

    "I Am Monarch"

    A shiver ran through Euphemia's spine.

    Because somehow… something was telling her.

    This was not a dream.
