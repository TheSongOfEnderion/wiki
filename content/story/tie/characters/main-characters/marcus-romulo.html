    Marcus Maximus Romulo is the main protagonist of the story [[tie]] and is one of the few Irregular Entities to exists in the entirety of existence. He follows the philosophy of [[Stoicism]] and tries his best to live a Virtuous life. His central principle is to "Do What Ought to be Done" and in doing so Marcus does not spare any effort. This exact principle is what led him to traverse entire realities in order to save his friend.

    As a regular human, Marcus did not received any gift during the Heaven's Fall and was also never chosen as a Champion, despite possessing all necessary qualities. He has no desire to be on the spotlight and simply wish to peacefully become an Engineer. But circumstances arise that his principles did not allow him to ignore, causing him to go on a journey to save his friends and eventually, become the Elucid King.

    Despite constantly claiming to be a regular normal human, to the dismay of those around him due to his blatant lack of awareness, Marcus is anything but a regular human. His uncannily fierce rationality, even before he became an Eldra, makes him more keen and adaptable to any situation, allowing him to take necessary risks, regardless of its threats to his life. Tempered and trained by the teachings of Ancient Stoics, Marcus developed a keen mental resistance to suffering, allowing him to survive through even the harshest of environment.

    # Appearance
    Marcus is a humble looking young man, with typical features of a Pilipino, light brown skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. His face is only average looking and his hair is always kept slightly long, with a bangs parting in front of his forehead.

    He has a 169cm height, which is tall by Pilipino standards. As a young child, Marcus never had any problems with his appearance and has always been satisfied with it. When he became a Frost SpiritReaver, his skin, hair, and iris became white and his body, previously skinny, started to grow a very refined muscle. His face also became geometrically balanced causing him to have a better looking face. After giving his powers to Isabelle, his skin was no longer white, but was certainly a lighter shade of brown. His hair became black again but his iris remained white.

    # Personality
    Marcus i

    Marcus was initially a shy and socially awkward young man with little to no friends. Though this changed when he was 15 years old and he found the comfort of books which taught him wisdom and reason, specifically, Marcus Aurelius. After five years, his learned to make proper friends and he became a normal, functioning adult who is emotionally mature and mentally stable as a result of his practice of Philosophy. He is also a clumsy person and often forgets stuffs. He can be quite humorous with his friends and he also, albeit not aware, gets along well with a lot of girls, more than he realize. When having fun, he tends to be quite bubbly and enjoy himself.

    At the beginning of the Recknoning, Marcus already possessed a strong and Iron Will, cultivated through Stoicism. This was even more tempered by the suffering he went through, eventually culminating into what Jolgnar calls, "The Ideal Man". Although usually very calm, he has a sinister side. Sufficiently depressed, he becomes psychopathic and capable of committing some very heinous acts. His doctor explained that Marcus' sociopathy and psychopathy was a result of his brain cancer.

    # Motivations
    Marcus initially just wanted to do what Ought to be done. As a result, he saved his friend Isabelle.

    Following that, the guilt he experienced due to causing Mitty's transmutation and having promised to save Jolgnar from Khione's graps motivated him through the middle part of the story. He gathered many materials and even built a super computer with the help of Dr. Martin and his apprentices. Marcus then found an Odin Key and opened a portal to Coeus Hermanus' Divine Realm in order to search for the elusive dwener knowledge.

    After he saved Mitty, Marcus helped his friends overtake one tower after another, as well as defeat their enemies. During this time, he decided to temporarily become a UHD Special Forces Captain using his connections in order to defeat a corrupt executive. But this decision led to a series of events, culminating into Marcus become a UHD Frontier Commander General in charge of defeating the invading demonic forces. Marcus accepted the role and choose to help save humanity.

    ## Internal Conflicts:
    * PTSD
    * Guilt from causing hunderds of death in the process of saving Isabelle
    * Gallius’ Death in his hands
    * MItty’s transmutation
    * Desire to Die
    * Lack of Value towards himself

    # History
    Marcus is very much aware of almost all of his flaws, insecurities, and psychological scars, however, quite a lot of time, he is not aware that these are affecting him.
    Low sense of value and a deep Inferiority Complex - While Marcus rationalizes that since he's going to die anyway, it's fine to sacrifice himself, his lows sense of personal value over himself cuts deeper to his childhood days and throughout his elementary and highschool days. As a young boy, Marcus has always been alone and found it difficult to make friends. He eventually formed the idea that people don't want him or there's something inherently broken and not good about him. As a result, he placed little value over himself and ended up being the boy that everyone takes advantage off. His sense of worthlessness was intensified in highschool when he wanted to have friends but throughout most of it, he was always left alone, mostly during pairings, group work where only he mostly works, cellphone or computer gameplays but he didn't have the money or device to join, as well as his avoidance to join his classmates on outings primarily due to his overprotective mother that preventive him from going away.

    This inferiority complex was also intensified when he could not bring himself to confess to the girls he had a crush with throughout junior highschool and senior highschool. As Marcus lived for 20 years without any romantic love, he has grown too alien from such emotions that he did not even knew that he had those feelings as he viewed himself too unworthy for anyone's affection. His self-deprecation and self-worthlessness is so intense that he could laugh at his own death with much indifference.

    This is one of the reason why he valued very much the close friends that accepted him during the last days of his junior high to the point that he's willing to risk his life to protect them.

    Superiority Complex - Ironically, Marcus also suffers from a deep superiority complex. As he's come to realized that he is far more intelligent than the average person. Also due to the fact that his mind was twisted and cultivated by many books which taught him how to scheme, deceive, and see through the lies of culture, Marcus started to have a superiority complex. However, this phase merely lasted his entire senior highschool days and was eventually over. But the sense of superiority that he feels which borderlines elitism still lingers within him and he tries his best not to let it affect him or those around him.

    Sociopathy - Marcus is very cold and calculating, a trait that he successfully cultivated by studying the books of his predecessors. Using their logic, Marcus is able to fully rationalize killing or ruining other people's lives. He is also able to disregard his or other people's lives if needed. He does all of these with pure logical and rational thinking. However, Marcus is not aware that normal people are unable, and does not even try, to rationalize the value of people's lives that some of them must absolutely die. No normal person would do this. Marcus, however, could do so and treat people's lives like numbers, even his own, with a cold detachment and absence of any remorse or sympathy.

    Much to Marcus' lack of awareness, his mother was overly protective of him, not merely out of love but also due to her desire to protect other children from him. From a young age, Marcus already showed signs of sociopathic behavior like how he brutally beat up his classmate from his first grade to the point where three of their teeth fall out. The child Marcus then reasoned out that he will not apologize because, "the kid annoyed him".

    Marcus also displayed the same behavior when he casually threw the corpse of the puppy that he and his female childhood friend raised when they were young. When the puppy died, marcus just picked its body and threw it to the trash can, causing his female childhood friend to cry and get so angry that she never talked to him again.

    Another case also happened during his Senior highschool days when three boys tried to harass him. Marcus then pulled out a knife and threatened them. Then he proceeded to stab his own self. Marcus then ran away, "crying". The next day, the three boy were called to the principal's office and were kicked out. Marcus' mother, as well as everyone in the teacher's faculty knew Marcus as a nice and diligent honor student and would therefore, do no harm to others. Thus everyone believed marcus and the three boys were kicked out of the school. Nobody believed them despite their best to explain that Marcus stabbed himself as they were delinquents. This caused the three children to not be accepted in any college they went. Marcus never showed remorse nor sympathy and, he coldly smiled at the three of them as they were escorted out of the school, causing them to get enraged.

    While Marcus certainly possess sociopathic behavior, he is not completely insane. It appears that his sociopathic traits mostly appears when he is stressed or under pressure and he would normally act like a functional normal human being and with, unironically, a deep empathic skills.

    ## Before the Reckoning

    **17th July 2025**
    A 14 years old Marcus found himself in his local library and accidentally read Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. He walked the path of stoicism from here on out, though he hasn't fully understood what it means to be a Stoic.

    **5th November 2026**
    Marcus sat before his house' sofa, looking at a television with planes flying down.

    At this moment, Marcus became an irregular entity. He utterly skipped the Veil and saw what lies Beyond the Horizon. The Horizon Event, the process of becoming an Irregular Entity, only lasted a fraction of a billionth of a second. Marcus died and his existence wiped out but he also immediately self-willed himself back to reality. Marcus then realized he wanted to become a Supreme Inventor.

    ### Senior Highschool days
    During the last days of his senior highschool when he was 18, Marcus became the target of four bullies. Initially, he dismissed them and told them to shoo away but they were persistent in harassing him, despite that, Marcus still remained calm. However, the end came when they tried harassing Marcus on the day he was depressed. There, Marcus brought them to a sufficiently absent back of the school where he brandished a knife and stab a few of them before proceeding to stabbing himself multiple times, and also in one critical region of his stomach. Marcus then shouted for help, to which a teacher passing by responded. Because he was a honour student and beloved by the faculty teachers, everybody believed Marcus' narrative and the four boys were expelled. Because of the framed up attempt on Marcus' life, the four guys failed to go to college as no school were willing to accept them, causing them to eventually have low-paying jobs and some of them turn to crime. During the reckoning, Marcus met two of them who angry assaulted him. He just quickly killed them with no regards.

    On his last year in Senior Highschool, he became classmates with Faustina. The two of them didn't clicked at first but as time goes on, Marcus found the "little shit" as he quoted it, quite interesting. He then proceeded to become close with her by constantly chatting with her till they became best friends. Three years later, they were still talking with each other until Marcus developed feelings for her.

    ### 1st Year College
    Marcus finally became a true stoic and he understood and lived most of its principles as best he can. His personality became calmer and he became more tolerant and social to his fellow men.

    **8th July 2031**
    Marcus confessed to Faustina and admit he likes her and wanted to court her. Faustina, however, did not rejected him. At this point, Marcus already noticed the decrease in their chat and her start of lack of interest, however, he believed he can overcome it.

    ## During the Reckoning
    9th July 2031
    On the 9th of July, year 2031, The Reckoning occurred, engulfing the world in fire and ash. Millions died and monsters of Ravish hunger entered the world.

    ### Ghost Reaver of the White
    Marcus had no idea what the White represents. Because he used to be mortal, he does not understand that the color of white he sees is not the same concept that the Eldras are seeing when they saw his Armor manifest into a White Color. This is because nobody has seen a manifestation of the White God for millennia's. The White God being known as the Missing God, and Marcus is, therefore, of the White. This, including his almost savage yet silent and quick fighting style made people call him as the Ghost Reaver of the White

    # Abilities
    **Irregular Entity** - As an Irregular entity, Marcus is not affected by destiny, cannot be perceived by Gods or Primordials, cannot be affected by Mental or Soul magic, and cannot be killed. He's no longer a human but an idea. For every time "Marcus" dies, another Marcus will appear in an altered reality which thinks, feels, and remembers like the previous Marcus but is entirely a separate entity. He is also capable of interfering with the laws of nature, so called "Miracles". Due to the volatility of his existence, directly affected by his emotion, he can accidentally slip through the fabrics of reality and fall to other dimensions. However, an Irregular Entity faces the danger of Zero-Sum, the deletion of their existence if they interfered too much and gained the attention of Nature or Godhead.

    At full mastery of their existence, an Irregular Entity is fully capable of altering Reality to however they wish with but a single thought. This is the power that Enderion possesses.

    **Frost SpiritReaver (Former)** - as a SpiritReaver, the highest just before a SpiritKing, Marcus became, in all sense, a Minor Deity. Marcus possessed Absolute Control over Ice and Snow. He also possess a practically infinite amount of energy capable of freezing entire areas the size of the moon with just a snap of his finger. Within Khione's Realm, the only one that posed a threat to him after becoming a Reaver was Gallius, also another SpiritReaver. At this state, Marcus was capable to casting the highest level of ice spells with little to no effort, preferring to use Sonada or Ice Ravaging Time as his generic attacks, whom Isabelle considers an ultimate spell that she cannot use.

    **Eldric Presence** - Even though Marcus is no longer an Eldra, its essence is still intact with him. As a result, Almost every other Eldric Beings still recognized him as an Eldrasil or a SpiritReaver. Any beast less than a SpiritReaver all subconsciously bows to him, allowing Marcus to simply howl at them to make them run in fear. He is also almost always treated like an Eldra and not a human by fellow Eldras.

    **High Human (Present)** - After losing his powers, by stabbing his heart, Marcus did not returned to a normal human but became a High Human. His body initially acted like that of a normal person, however, as time goes on, it became apparent that his body was obviously permanently altered due to his transformation into a SpiritReaver. His body slowly started to display incredible feats of strength, capable of bending metal easily and even going toe to toe with Champions. Slowly, his body started showing extreme speed, superhuman strength, high mental capacity, slowed time perception, immunity towards magic, and invulnerability towards temperature magic. Regardless of the temperature, it does not affect him. His perception also starts becoming keener every waking moment to the point that he can notice the tiniest of dust specs.

    **Combat Mastery** - Trained by Gallius and Jolgnar, both masters of combat, Marcus possess extreme combat skills that only few can barely keep up with him, limited only by his present strength.

    **Invention Skills** - Very inventive in nature, Marcus used his craftiness to create many different kinds of Artifacts such as the Mathers Hand which he uses as a proxy to artificially wield magic, as well as the Magic Gun. With his invention and the research of his predecessors, Marcus created Veronica, his ultimate magnum opus.

    **Insidious Cunningness** - Very evil in nature, Marcus showed a natural talent in cunningness and deception, often times preferring to deceive and fool his enemies because it's a lot more "fun" than simply blowing them up by force. People are more afraid of him due to his frightening intelligence than anything else. Always a step-ahead of everyone, Marcus seems to possess omniscience. In reality, he is also the perpetrator of many accidents he also fixed himself, to which he controlled the events so that he could eliminate problems as well as profit for himself. Initially questioning his methods, after Satoru became broken by his own ideals, he become loyal to Marcus that he'd even commit murder in his name.

    **Nigh-Omnipotent Mental Strength** - As a consequence of seeing the Beyond and not losing Rationality (though he did went mad), Marcus possess a ridiculously powerful mind, easily overpowering practically anyone, even a deity. It's mere limitation is Marcus' belief over himself. As long as his belief is not broken, not even Fygnell, the very god of Madness and Rationality can fight him in a mental battle. Almost every single one that entered Marcus' mind has lost their mind and went insane and almost always killing themselves hours later. This also means that no Mental or Soul Magic can affect him.
