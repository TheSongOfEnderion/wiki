    This story begun with its end, as Marcus Romulo received news that he had an incurable brain cancer. Without much to do, he went to the rooftop of his apartment and tried drinking away the agony of having to leave his loved ones behind. But on that day, a voice echoed through the skies, demanding humanity to fight for the One, followed by the appearance of a raining aurora granting people mysterious abilities. Portals and towers then appeared all over the world, bringing with it monsters of ravish hunger.

    As the World around him descents to madness, Marcus calmly drunk his beer. None of these mattered to the Stoic Marcus. Ungifted and unchosen by the Gods, the powerless Marcus just wanted two things; to find a cure for his cancer, and if not, to have fun with what little time he had left, and to have a Good Death.
