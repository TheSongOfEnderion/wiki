    **Librarian Comment**: This book was actually written by my Ancestor who actually lived in the age when the Ancient Heroes were still alive! How exciting it is! Even my entire family didn't knew we had an ancestor like this! But back then, this book was merely called, "Heroes", and I renamed so that it'll fit its meaning. After all, its been a thousand years since then.
