    **Author**: Lyrea Faust
    **Category**: Myths and Religion
    **Archived by**: Bardin the Handsome
    **Librarian Comment**: I found this copy inside the bag of a dead Shadowfaust I met on my way towards Sarashi. I knew well how that sneaky race cares so much about family, so I buried him in a few meters off the road and placed a huge wooden sign over it. When I arrived at a City, I sent a letter towards the Darth Mausiloum, hopefully, those guys can pick him up. I also tried reading this book, but fucking hell it just gives me the creeps! I immediately closed it before I even finished reading the 5th commandment. I swear by the Divines, this book is cursed.

    **Book Content**:

    By my Will, all of you were created, and by my Will all of you will die.
