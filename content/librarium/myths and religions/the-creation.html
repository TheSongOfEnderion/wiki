    **Librarian Comment**: This was a short book translated from the Forgotten tongue by the Light Satyrs. Interestingly, this particular copy shows no signs of erosion or damage regardless of whatever we hit it with, physical or magical. As such its impossible to determine the age of this golden book. Because of its invulnerability, I even used it as a cannon-ball to kill a chaos titan. It's very effective I tell ya.

    **Book Content**:

    In the beginning, among the ashes of those that came before, arose a single being.

    Enderion.

    With his Hammer and the Eternal forge, Enderion crafted all of reality.

    The first hit of the hammer, Space was born.

    The second hit of the hammer, Time was born.

    The third hit of the hammer, Matter was born.

    The fourth hit of the hammer, Stars were born.

    The fifth hit of the hammer, Galaxies were born.

    The sixth hit of the hammer, Planets were born.

    The seventh hit of the hammer, Dimensions were born.

    The eight hit of the hammer, Ideas were born.

    The ninth hit of the hammer, Life was born.

    But Enderion witnessed the life he had forged from the ninth hit. And he felt pity, for they moved, but they have no mind. They eat, but they could not taste. They see, but they could not react.

    And so Enderion took a piece of his soul, placed it within the Eternal Forge, and hit it with his hammer.

    The tenth hit of the hammer, the Souls were born.

    And from the largest fragments of his soul, the gods arose. From the tiniest pieces, the mortals were born. And from the soul fragments of Enderion whom were shaded with darkness, the Eldritch were created.

    And when his children kneeled before him, begging for an answer for why they were born, Enderion was silent. And then he replied.

    "Seek the meaning of Existence", and so on the tenth and last hit of his hammer, Enderion rested within the canvas. Comforted by his Left, and his Right.

    He saw the Entirety of existence that he created, and he was satisfied.
