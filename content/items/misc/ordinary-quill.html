    The Ordinary Quill is a powerful [[Divine Artefact]] of the [[White God]]. It was first created by a humble elf from the [[Mythic Era]] as a gift to the then wondering [[White God]]. When the child died, the [[White God]] eternalized her memory upon the quill, giving it the ability to reveal any and all information to the user. Though because of the way the quill works by extracting the user's soul to the [[Forest of Eternal Truth]], it eventually turns them insane.

    # History
    When the [[White God]] walked [[Mirdum]] as a humble mortal, he met [[Calliope]], a humble and naive elven child. The [[White God]], trying to understand mortals, decided to adopt and take care of her.

    During those days, the [[White God]] learned what happiness, kindness, and what being a human means. As [[Calliope]] taught her these, the [[White God]], for a moment, became truly mortal. But not all things last for long and [[Calliope]] died by the hands of another mortal. Because of this the [[White God]] learned of the concept of death and mortality.

    He took [[Calliope | Calliope's]] soul. It's unknown what he did with it.

    To honour Calliope, he immortalized her memory in the Ordinary Quill she gave him, giving it the ability to reveal any knowledge, a remembrance of [[Calliope | Calliope's]] thirst for knowledge.

    # Ability
    * **Omniscient Knowledge Revelation** - It can reveal any knowledge that the user writes with it through their dream. However, continuous usage of the ability, the constant transportation of the soul to the [[Forest of Eternal Truth]] will eventually erode the user's mind. It can also instantly drive the user insane if they write knowledge that is beyond the comprehension of the mortal mind.

    # Known Users
    * [[Euphemia Trysten]] - The Empress who united all of Loreteia,
