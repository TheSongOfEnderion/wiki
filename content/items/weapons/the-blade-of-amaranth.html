    Is a mysterious and extremely powerful blade, who according to [[Fygnell]], has been used by the Enderion of the previous kalpa. The blade never dulls and no amount of fire could melt it. Its main characteristics is its ability to duplicate the user's attacks. It is currently wielded by Marcus Romulo as his signature weapon.

    # History
    When Marcus Romulo had to fight the **Eldric Lord of Chaos and Soul Severance**, he invaded the **[[Template of Chrysanthemum]]** to steal its powerful sword. After successfully defeating its guardians, Marcus pulled the sword off of its pedestal and chains, surprising even [[Jolgnar]] and the Chief Guardian. For Blade of Amaranth was not destined to Marcus, and pulling it off means he **broke all known laws of reality**.

    # Ability
    The Blade of Amaranth is capable of a variety of feats that no other blade could replicate.
    * **Attack Duplication** - Each of the user's strikes are duplicated, as if another blade appears. So a single strike will result in ten strikes.
    * **Future Sight** - It gives the user the ability to see multiple possible realities letting them predict their enemy's attacks.
    * **Avatar of Amaranth** - It can summon a mysterious and powerful warrior to aid the user in battle.
    * **Superhuman Strength** - The blade choses its master and should the user be worthy, it grants them a mighty strength.
    * **Hyper Endurance** - It gives the user a great endurance.

    ## Weakness
    The blade, although powerful, almost always drives its users insane after a while of using it. But it had no effect on marcus, as he quotes, "You cannot drive an insanse person mad, for he's already insane".
