    # Appearance
    She usually takes the form of a beautiful and cute little girl with extremely long and silky black hair dripping on the floor, as well as wearing a small white dress filled with intricate flower designs. Her eyes are grey and her skin is quite is a little beige, with a shade of lilac.

    # Personality
    She likes to play music, and is usually seen playing a piano or a guitar within her Bone Realm of the Dead. Her music is reminiscent of her previous mortal life as she used to be one. She has a pleasant personality, seemingly kind, polite, and very calm. But once excited, her eyes turns red and she starts displaying erratic and psychotic behavior.

    She loves eating the flesh of anything, be it sentient or animal, she will devour them. She reasons out that she is honoring the dead by making use of their bodies and not letting it rot.

    # History
    Micthianteculou demanded Benjamin to devour the flesh of humans if he wants to obtain her favour.
