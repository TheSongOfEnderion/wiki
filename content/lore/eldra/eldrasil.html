    Eldrasils or Spirit Reavers. From the word "Eldra" meaning spirit and "Sil" meaning reaver. Their power is second only to [[Eldrada | Eldradas]]. They are commonly called as minor gods.

    An Eldrasil possess supreme control over their aspect, though not as powerful as the Eldrada that represents that aspect. They possess a power enough to wipe out entire planets or destroy an entire planetary systems. As minor gods, they possess [[Universal Authority]], much like an [[Eldrada]] and therefore, can weave destiny to some extent.

    # Birth
    An Eldrasil is born from a being who usurped an Elder Spirit or who mantled another Eldrasil and took over their aspect. There are very very few mortals who actually became an Eldrasil as such an event is infinitely rare. Their numbers throughout eternity can fit a person's hands.
