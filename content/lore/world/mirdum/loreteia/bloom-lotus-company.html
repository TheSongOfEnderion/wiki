    The Bloom Lotus Company is an ancient courier and news company created before the [[First Era]] even began. Co-founded by the [[Mad Scholar]] along with [[Jackson the Retard]], it outlived practically every Empire, Kingdoms, and living beings born within Loreteia from the past to the present.

    The company also keeps the Sacred [[Librarium Sanctum]] where it keeps records of every single literature, book, scrolls, and history that sprung within Loreteia.

    # Founding
    When the [[Mad Scholar]] was busy searching for the Legendary [[Bloom Doom Shroom]], he met [[Jackson the Retard]], a fellow homeless man also addicted to [[Bloom Jelly]]. Hateful of what his life has become, [[Jackson the Retard]] roped the [[Mad Scholar]] to help him create a Newspaper company, a dream that Jackson always wanted to fulfill. In exchange of being able to name it, the [[Mad Scholar]] agreed. Together, they scraped the necessary funds for their venture. The [[Mad Scholar]] invented the printing press and "hired every homeless kid and lunatics" he could find to get free information in exchange for a few cups of rice. [[Jackson the Retard]] then went on to convince towns to subscribe to his weekly newspaper and even went so far as to convince the gods to buy from him, a feat no mortal back then dared to do except for the [[Mad Scholar]].

    They faced many setbacks and sabotage from enemy companies, however, their advantage came from the fact that the Bloom Lotus Company is an independent, non-partisan organization which does not align to any faction or god. As a result, every other faction bought news from them to confirm whatever info they got of their enemies. As the only neutral party, add to the fact that they're both bloom addicts not take too seriously by major players, they succeeded in surviving and eventually conquering the entire market. Although future scholars would say that the [[Mad Scholar]] would write a ton of unverifiable, harmless articles just to get interests and buyers. In fact, rumors has it that the [[Mad Scholar]] and [[Jackson the Retard]], even went so far as invent entire cultures, races, beliefs, or practices that never even existed in the first place. It is said that these two were singlehandedly responsible for influencing every single beliefs and culture in Loreteia.

    # Librarium Sanctum
    The Librarium Sanctum was originally the [[Mad Scholar | Mad Scholar's]] personal library where he gathered every single books he could get his hands on. But the [[Mad Scholar]] is so disorganized that his assistant, [[Bardin the Handsome]], took it upon himself to manage the library. After the Mad Scholar saved the [[Elder Tree]], [[Bardin the Handsome]] forced the [[Mad Scholar]] to take [[Elder Wood]] as his reward so that the Library and its books can be kept in pristine condition. Over the years, the library grew so large that [[Bardin the Handsome]] feared it would get burned down, like what usually happens to other libraries back then.

    Influenced by the [[Mad Scholar | Mad Scholar's]] craziness, [[Bardin the Handsome]] made a pact with an Oldrim god in order to acquire an artifact that would move the Library to a secret dimension, safe from all manners of danger. As part of the Bloom Lotus Company's Philanthropic work which is said to have been motivated by the "chaos caused by the Mad Scholar", copies of the Library were created all throughout Loreteia. So that if those libraries were to burn down, nothing would be lost and everything can be rebuilt again.
