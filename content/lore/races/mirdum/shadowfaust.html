    # Origin


    # History
    All shadowfaust descended from a Princess in a forgotten empire. Lyrea Faust, the fourth Princess was a forgotten princess of the then Empire. But after the death of her beloved mother, she became a powerful illusionist and assassin who eventually became powerful enough that she conceived and understood the Aspect of Mystery. This allowed her to Apotheosis and become a Deity. She is, what people would call, a Progenitor, mortals who reached Deity hood. But during this time, she met the Fygnell who went to the mortal world to have fun. The two of them became companions as they journeyed. Eventually, the two fell in love and from their love was born a child neither fully human nor fully divine. After many generations, the Shadowfaust Clan expanded and became a race of extremely powerful stealth users. While they remain as one of the fewer in population, they remained as one of the strongest race.

    The Shadowfaust considered the Pelinial Planes, a small region in Loretia as their Ancestral Home as this is the place where Lyrea’s mother was born.

    # Society and Culture
    Marriage is an extremely sacred ritual to the Shadowfaust. Because their race is connected by the gift of Madness and Rationality of Fygnell, relationship is very important to them. When a Shadowfaust cheated on their partner, this is usually met with blood and carnage as the gift of madness within them will activate. This is why most races are very cautious in forming bonds with a Shadowfaust. While the bond will be extremely strong, should they transgress this, they will be met with a maddened lover who will destroy everything in their wake.

    **Sacred Parentage** - The shadowfaust are unique from other races in that no Shadowfaust can be born unless the Queen Mother gives her blessing upon them. The Shadowfaust, no matter how many sex they do, will not be able to conceive a child. Is only by going on a pilgrimage and showing to the Queen Mother that they are worthy to care for a child, that they will be good parents, that they will be able to conceive a child. They then sign a pact with the Queen Mother that they will be good parents. Those that transgress this pact will be sent to Nifelheim upon their death and suffer and only if their child undergoes the Redemption Pilgrimage for their parents, will they be forgiven.

    # Religion
    ## Revered Symbol:

    * [[Fygnell]] – The Shadowfausts considers Fygnell as their Ancestral Father who gave them the gift of madness and rationality.
    * [[the-crazy-inventor | Thaal]] – Whilst not worshipped in the same way the Shadowfaust would worship Fygnell or the Queen Mother, Thaal is a legendary figure among the shadowfaust tribe as a being that represents the epitome of human madness, the achievement of threatening the very gods themselves just for his whims.
