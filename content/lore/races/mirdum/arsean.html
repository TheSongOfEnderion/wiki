    Denizens of Aulmeria. Crafty and very intelligent, the Arseans were the ones who led the Continental Conquest of Nicholas the Great and successfully conquered all of Loreteia. They pride themselves in their strategical, crafts, mercantile, and oratorical skills. Despite their weaker strength, they have the strongest stamina among the human race.

    # Aulmeria
    Aulmeria is the central region of Loreteia and has been the heart of many Empires in the past. As it is centered in the continent, it experiences four seasons. It contained many grassy plains, forest, and a natural mountain range that separates it from the other regions, making it easy to defend against foreign invaders. Aulmeria is the native homes of Nemines and later on, Invirians.

    # Physiology
    Appearance. The skins of Arseans varies in color but are mostly light. Their hair is commonly blonde, light blonde, platinum, or sometimes brown.

    Abilities. They do not have much in terms of physical strength but they are the most intelligent and gifted in intellect amongst men. Because of this, the Arseans has been known as a race of eloquent and scholarly men. This is the reason why most Emperors are predominantly Arsean as the gift of intelligence is far more needed when ruling. Their sophisticated ways often clash with Celts who sees Arseans as sissies and weak pussies. Arseans are said to be the descendants of a group of humans who once lived in Aulmeria, called the Invirians who, according to scriptures, are generally more intelligent than Arseans, whose most intellectual member of them is but an average among Invirians.

    # Origin
    The Arseans are said to have come from the western continent. According to the earliest text left behind by Arsean Ancestors, the western continent, also known as the Forbidden Continent was known to them as, "The Demon's Land". The Arseans Ancestors back then were weak and fragile and easily devoured by superior races. As a consequence, only the most intelligent and craftiest of the Arsean Ancestors survived, causing them to become the most inherently intelligent human race.

    # History
    Many Emperors have originated from the Arsean race.
