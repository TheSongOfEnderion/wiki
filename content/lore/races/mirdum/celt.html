    # Heilgrim
    Heilgrim is a very mountainous and steep region of Loreteia. Many of its parts also contain great plains and astounding river. Because of both openness and narrowness of Heilgrim, its people learned how to fight in both landscape, making them very effective warriors. Heilgrim also possess a cold and frigid region, making most of its citizens resistant to the cold.

    # Physiology
    The Celts are mostly light skinned people who commonly possess blonde or orange hair. Most of them have blue or brown eyes and a very well built body with strong muscles.
    The muscles of Celts grow differently compared to other human race. Their muscles grow to become very strong and tensile that normal knives cannot pierce them. Every celts possess superhuman strength which Ironically made their civilization lag behind in terms of architecture as their strength can destroy flimsy houses. Celts also possess great endurance and regeneration, allowing them to go into prolong fights without losing despite suffering many injuries. They are also resistant to frost which allowed them to thrive in the frigid region of Heilgrim.

    A Celt that has achieved great Martial Prowess can consciously control the strength of their muscles through a breathing technique. The Breathing Techniques of Celts are closely guarded by families and masters and access to them is only given after giving a lifelong oath.
    Because of the inherent Superhuman Strength of Celts, the people of Loreteia dare not underestimate even a petite and fragile looking celt as even little girls of the Celtic people can deal quite the damage to the unguarded adult.

    # Origin
    The Ancestors of Celts originated from a Continent East of Loreteia. In this continent, they lived together with the Sea Satyr. Because of a war that destroyed that continent, it is said that the Ancestors of Sea Satyrs and Celts sailed west together In search of new lands. The two race separated when the Sea Satyr found the Dragon Archipelago quite suitable to their living while the Celts continued west. This is the reason why the two are neighboring regions and that for generations, trade and cooperation bloomed between the two races.

    # History
    The Celts and Sea Satyrs are very close to one another as the two share a culture of Warriorship and bravery. Scholars says that there might be some credibility to the tale of Celts and Sea Satyr's as some Celtic Family are very resistant to Water magick and some of them, despite never going to sea, are very well endowed in the skills of swimming. This evidence suggest that there might have been some interbreeding between Celtic Ancestors and Sea Satyrian Ancestors.

    # Society and Culture
    The celts possess a predominantly warrior culture, however, this is a misnomer according to Celts themselves. The culture of Celts centered around the values of Bravery, Courage, Fortitude, and Willpower. These values are often times needed by a warrior which made Celts give the impression of warriors.

    The Art of Smithing is very well respected in Heilgrim and every city contained at least one Smithing Family. Weapons forged by Celts are sought after by almost every warrior in Loreteia as the impressive strength of Celts led them to use it in creating fine weapons that is said to "not break even in the face of a minotaur".

    ## Rock Tree
    When the Celts arrived from the east, it is said that they carried two seeds with them. One of them is the Rock Tree. The possess incredible strength and endurance. Using this tree, the celts created a unique architecture designed for themselves that took into consideration of their great strength.

    ## Iron Tree
    According to Legends, Celtic Ancestors were once normal humans with [[Arsean]] level of strength. But due to a huge famine and death of plants, the Celts were forced to eat the fruit of the only surviving tree within their former deathly homeland, the Iron Tree. The Celts eventually developed a belly acid to sufficiently digest Iron Fruits and observed its nutrients. A thousand years passed and the weak and fragile that couldn't digest an Iron Fruit died and only the strong survived.

    The Celts gain their strength from the near metal hard Iron Fruit. It is extremely sacred to them and each Celtic village keeps an Iron Tree at the center of their land where a Priest takes care of it everyday.

    ## Values
    Celts have emphasis on social relationships, particularly, "Family" and "Mentorship".
    When a Celt accept a master, they consider that master like a parent for the rest of their life and they must do everything they can to protect and preserve the dignity of their master. In turn, the master will impart all his knowledge and techniques to his disciples. A famous tale that had a permanent impact on the Celtic culture was the "Tale of Two masters".

    # Religion
    The Celts worship almost the same Divine Pantheon as the Arseans, however, rather than human figures, the Celts have given their gods a more beastly and animal figures.
    Their culture deeply worship the Celtic equivalent of the Arsean depiction of Yngdall, who is known as Ynegarm. Ynegarm as Is known as the Beast Warrior God to the celts. Trolls are common in the frozen north of Heilrim. A lot of Celts own a troll as a house guardian. Trolls are very pack focused and would protect their family with their life.
