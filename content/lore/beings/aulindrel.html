    Also known as the Land Goddess, Protector of Mortals, and Creator of Raekirnu. Aulindrel is an extremely powerful [[Elf]] Wizard from the [[Eternal Era]] and the last of her race living in [[Mirdum]]. She is a [[Quasi Deity]], well capable of destroying entire continents.

    A servant of [[Artoria]], Aulindrel remained in [[Mirdum]] and wakes up every thousand years, waiting for the return of her master. Every now and then, she goes around the world to check if the Time Freezing spells she cast upon the remnants of her Civilization still remains.

    Due to boredom, Aulindrel would sometimes take in disciples and turn them into powerful beings of their era. She has little to no care for mortal affairs anymore as she witness civilizations and myths arise and fell as quickly as the gales of wind.
