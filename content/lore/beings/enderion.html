    The Allmaker, Allfather, or known as the Almighty Profound Creator of the Universe. It is said that should one hear the Song of Enderion, they will become enlightened and understand the meaning of Life.

    Although he created the gods and all of primordials, he himself is not a god but a mere mortal.
